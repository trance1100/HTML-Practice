Bandit Level 5 -> Level 6

Level Goal

The password for the next level is stored in a file somewhere under the inhere directory and has all of the following properties:

    human-readable
    1033 bytes in size
    not executable


Walkthrough:
This one is kinda tricky at first, but after reading the documentation of certain commands and the simple understanding of pipes it becomes a walk in the park.

I just ran this command.

find ! -executable | du -ab | grep -e 1033

I searched through the multiple directories and found the executables,
after that I found the different sizes in bytes and finally tried to find the one that matched 1033 bytes using grep.

Bandit Level 8 → Level 9

Level Goal

The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt and is the only line of text that occurs only once

Walkthrough: 
At first looking for a unique line of text resulted quite difficult due to the fact that there were so many outputs.
It's easy to overlook the fact that these might have been repeated but some letters have been simply capitalized.
So I sorted them out first and then looked for the unique line of text.
