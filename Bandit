Bandit Level 5 -> Level 6

Level Goal

The password for the next level is stored in a file somewhere under the inhere directory and has all of the following properties:

    human-readable
    1033 bytes in size
    not executable


Walkthrough:
This one is kinda tricky at first, but after reading the documentation of certain commands and the simple understanding of pipes it becomes a walk in the park.

I just ran this command.

find ! -executable | du -ab | grep -e 1033

I searched through the multiple directories and found the executables,
after that I found the different sizes in bytes and finally tried to find the one that matched 1033 bytes using grep.

The password for the next level is stored somewhere on the server and has all of the following properties:

    owned by user bandit7
    owned by group bandit6
    33 bytes in size

Walkthrough:
This one is similar to the one before. We just search through the server for files belonging to the user and group.
While supressing error messages to find out the file that has the password

The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt next to the word millionth

Walkthrough:
Another simple one, we search through a txt file using grep to find the patter millionth.
and next to it the password.

Bandit Level 8 → Level 9

Level Goal

The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt and is the only line of text that occurs only once

Walkthrough: 
At first looking for a unique line of text resulted quite difficult due to the fact that there were so many outputs.
It's easy to overlook the fact that these might have been repeated but some letters have been simply capitalized.
So I sorted them out first and then looked for the unique line of text.

The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt in one of the few human-readable strings, beginning with several ‘=’ characters.

Walkthrough:
I searched through the file for printable strings and then serached for the one that contained a '='.

Bandit Level 10 → Level 11
Level Goal

The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt, which contains base64 encoded data

Walkthrough:
We use the base64 command to decode the data.

Bandit Level 11 → Level 12
Level Goal

The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt, where all lowercase (a-z) and uppercase (A-Z) letters have been rotated by 13 positions

Walkthrough:
Just change back the characters by 13 positions and you'll be able to decode the message again.

Bandit Level 12 → Level 13
Level Goal

The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt, which is a hexdump of a file 
that has been repeatedly compressed. For this level it may be useful to create a directory 
under /tmp in which you can work using mkdir. For example: mkdir /tmp/myname123. 
Then copy the datafile using cp, and rename it using mv (read the manpages!)

Walkthrough:
This one is honestly kinda complicated if you're just a beginner just starting out.
But there is a lot to learn about this one level, like file compression, how to determine what type of info 
a file contains with file command. Its very tedius to constantly uncompress files and determine the type
and the file extensions that each command takes in.

Bandit Level 13 → Level 14
Level Goal

The password for the next level is stored in /etc/bandit_pass/bandit14 and can only be 
read by user bandit14. For this level, you don’t get the next password, but you get a 
private SSH key that can be used to log into the next level. Note: localhost is a hostname
that refers to the machine you are working on

Walkthrough:
This one was simple enough, you specify the ssh-key and then just use it to log in to the next level.
From here you'll be able to obtain the

The password for the next level can be retrieved by submitting the password of the current level
to port 30000 on localhost.

Walkthrough:
Just as the description says, we just connect to that sever and input the password.
And we receive the password for level 15. It was that simple!
Also learn about ports and localhost and nc and all that good stuff.

Bandit Level 13 → Level 14
Level Goal

The password for the next level is stored in /etc/bandit_pass/bandit14 and can only be 
read by user bandit14. For this level, you don’t get the next password, but you get a 
private SSH key that can be used to log into the next level. Note: localhost is a hostname
that refers to the machine you are working on

Walkthrough:
Just look for the port that speaks ssl, pass it the password, get the key and then pass that private RSA key 
to ssh to log in to the next level.
